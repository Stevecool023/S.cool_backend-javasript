// The 'const' keyword allows you to declare a constant (a JavaScript variable with a constant value).

// Constants are similar to let variables, except that the value cannot be changed.

var x = 3; {
	console.log(x);  // Here x is 3
}

{
	const x = 10;  // Here x is 10
	console.log(x);
}

console.log(x);  // Here x is 3
